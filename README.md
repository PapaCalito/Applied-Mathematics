# Applied-Mathematics
Different programms in Matlab for: Numerical computation of Matrix Norms, Matrix decomposition (LR, QR) , Iterative Methods (Gauss- Seidel, Jacobi, Richardson) , Gradient Method, Conjugate Gradient, curve fitting

The different programs listed, where develop together with a lecture, Numerical Mathematics, at the University of Ulm. The algorithms to the different problems can be develop, trough simple
calculation, and then develop into a matlab function (.m). We first calculated the Norm for Matrix, then we have analized the Matrix decomposition, with the goal
of solving the problem Ax=b, where A is a Matrix from the n-dimensional Euclidean space and b is a vector from the same dimension.
After analyzing the different methods and ways of computing, to optamize the process and use less computer power, we studied the different iterative Methods.
In the End we applied all what we have learned to curve fitting. Havin an amount of data, we tried to solve the problem trough either the NOrmal equation, or diffferent Matrix decompositions.
Here the Matrix A, was containing the data.
